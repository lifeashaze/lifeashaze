## Hi, I'm Abhishek 👋

MS in Computer Science at Northeastern University  
Actively seeking **Software Engineering, Data, and AI Internships (Summer–Fall 2026)**

I enjoy building backend-heavy systems and AI-powered products that are designed to ship, not just demo.
Lately, I’ve been focused on LLM-based tooling, embedding-driven systems, and turning ideas into usable prototypes quickly.

### 🎯 What I'm looking for
- Backend-leaning software engineering roles  
- Data, platform, or AI engineering internships  
- Small, fast-moving teams that value ownership, iteration, and strong fundamentals
